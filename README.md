# SNKRS-Bot
Bot for Nike Snkrs app 
This is a Selenium bot for buying a given sneaker from the Nike Snkrs website ON RELEASE DAY. It will not work for sneakers that are past their release day (or later in the release day). Please note that this script was written with the US site in mind, so Nike sites for other countries will likely cause problems. This is because the purchase page changes to where the buy button redirects to a seperate checkout page (as opposed to a direct buy popup during release). It is a commandline script written solely in python. Ive managed to use this to Buy rare sneakers and resell them. Using this bot, ive resold over 5000$ worth of shoes and made over 2000$ in profit
